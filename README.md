Tenda GoAhead Embedded Web Server Exploit - Auth Bypass

I recently discovered that administration panels of Tenda routers using the GoAhead Embedded Web Server are directly accessible without requiring authentication. The client connected to the administration panel then has privileges and the ability to perform operations on the relevant routers.

This code is designed to check if the administration panel of Tenda routers using the GoAhead Embedded Web Server is accessible by verifying the presence of /index.html.

However, I observed that some routers redirect the client connected to the administration panel to /login.html after a few seconds. This page subsequently requests authentication information for access to the router's administration panel.

# Shodan :
You can use the following search filters to find vulnerable servers via Shodan : http.html:"data" http.favicon.hash:-2145085239 / http.html:"Status" http.favicon.hash:-2145085239

There are approximately +2500 affected routers that are accessible from the internet.
